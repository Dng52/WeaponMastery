    <p><strong>Keywords:</strong></p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li><strong style="color:#ffcc00;>Weapon DC:</strong>8 + Proficiency + Strength (or Dexterity if the weapon is finesse)</li>
        <li><strong>Brace:</strong> As an Action you choose to Brace. On your turn, choose any targets you can see that are at least 20 feet away from you. If any one of those targets move within your weapon’s reach before your next turn, you can make one melee attack against it with your weapon, which uses your reaction. If the attack hits, treat the attack as a critical hit. While bracing, you cannot use a reaction. While bracing, if you move or are moved against your will, you forfeit the reaction until your next turn. A brace attack is not an Opportunity Attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Deflect:</strong> If struck by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to roll your weapon’s damage plus your strength modifier, then subtract that total from the damage dealt to you for one attack. If you are dual wielding deflect weapons and you deflect one attack, you may deflect another attack as a free action on the same turn.</li>
        <li><strong>Disarm:</strong>On hit, you can choose to deal only your Strength modifier in damage and force your enemy to roll a Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failure, it drops one held object of your choice, landing within 5ft of it. If the enemy is larger than you or is using a two-handed weapon, it gains advantage on this save. If it is smaller than you, it suffers disadvantage. Shields that are strapped to the arm are immune to Disarm.</li>
        <li><strong>Trip:</strong>If your attack is successful, you can choose to deal only your Strength modifier in damage and your enemy must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw or be knocked prone. Enemies 1 size category larger than you gain advantage on this save. Enemies two size categories larger than you are immune to being tripped in this way.</li>
       <li><strong>Conceal</strong>You gain advantage on Sleight of Hand Checks made to conceal the weapon on your person. If it is discovered, some conceal weapons still require the searching party to make a successful Intelligence check to identify what it is.</li>
        <li><strong>Lunge:</strong>If you use the attack action, you can use your reaction to lunge and increase your range by 5ft for all other attacks the rest of the turn. This ends with your turn and cannot be used as part of an Opportunity Attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Entangle:</strong>On hit, you can choose to deal only your Strength modifier in damage and force the enemy to succeed on a Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw or be grappled. To escape, the entangled target must succeed a grapple check against your weapon DC, gaining advantage if it is larger than you. Creatures two size categories larger than you are immune to being entangled.</li>
        <li><strong>Penetrate:</strong>While attacking an enemy using a shield or wearing heavy armor, you can roll total damage from your weapon twice and take the better result.</li>
        <li><strong>Doubled Ended</strong>You make an additional attack as a bonus action using the damage listed, if you are within 5 ft of your target and wielding your weapon with two hands. Double Ended attacks do not benefit from Reach.</li>
        <li><strong></strong></li>
